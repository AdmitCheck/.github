With AdmitCheck, universities can automatically pre-evaluate applications for completeness and eligibility. This means that more applications are processed faster, errors are reduced and admission decisions are made more quickly. AdmitCheck supports admissions offices in all important matters relating to admission:

- Determination of university entrance qualifications.
- Accreditation assessment of foreign institutions.
- Automatic grade conversion.
- Comparison of programme-specific criteria.
- AI and OCR-supported document verification.

AdmitCheck provides a secure, developer-friendly REST API that integrates seamlessly with campus management systems. We are fully GDPR-compliant, with data protection and security embedded in our design and operations.
